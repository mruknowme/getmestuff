        <h4>Delivery of Product for a Fully Pledged Wish</h4>
        <p>Once your wish gets fully pledged, meaning received the full amount, customer support team will check the wish has followed all the rules and requirements, in case no violations were found, they will contact you to confirm the delivery address and other details that might be needed for the delivery and then initiate the delivery.</p>
        <p>When the team contacts you regarding the delivery, one of the following things may happen:</p>
        <ul class="list disc">
            <li>
                <p>The amount of pledges received is enough for the customer support team to purchase the product or service and organize delivery. In this case, the purchase and delivery will be initiated immediately.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The amount of pledges received is not enough for purchasing and/or delivering the product/service. In this case you will be given two options:</p>
                <ul class="list circle">
                    <li>
                        <p>You may choose to pay the missing amount by yourself, in which case you will receive all the needed instructions and an invoice.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>You may choose to increase the number of pledges needed and wait until you receive enough.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the customer support team notified you that your wish violates the rules, the wish will be removed and no product/service purchase and delivery will be initiated. No refunds will be given. The customer support team in such event will have to give a valid reason for this decision. All decisions are final.</p>
        <p>Please note, GetMeStuff uses only trusted suppliers/retailers and delivery companies, thereby guarantees safe purchase and ensures that the needed product will be delivered in appropriate conditions, unless the user gave false delivery address, in which case GetMeStuff is not liable and no refunds will be given. It is solely the Administration’s discretion to decide whether the supplier/retailer can be trusted, if the decision is negative the Administration will look for alternative trusted suppliers/retailers. If the Administration fails to find a trusted supplier/retailer of the needed product/service two following options will be offered:</p>
        <ul class="list dash">
            <li>
                <p>The purchase and delivery can be initiated with the untrusted supplier/retailer at the user’s risk, hence GetMeStuff is no longer liable for the delivery of the requested product/service.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Choose another wish, that is bounded by the rules of publishing a wish and terms of service, and pledges will be transferred to the new wish.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If GetMeStuff fails to find any suppliers/retailers of the requested product only the second option will be offered.</p>
        <p>GetMeStuff undertakes to inform the user about the status of looking for a trusted supplier/retailer on a regular basis.</p>
