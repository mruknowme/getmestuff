        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>It all begins with passion to accomplish our goals. Nearly always, to get where we want, we need other tools, a car, a house, a new phone, etc… you get the point. The question is, how to get it having no money to invest?</p>

        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>And this is how the idea was born, with a wild thought, which meant to be just a joke, we imagined, what if thousands of people gave us just as little as a dollar? This could change the game… This, almost immediately, became a business idea with a vision to connect and inspire people to give just a little help to each other to accomplish much greater goals.</p>
