        <h4>I couldn’t publish my wish, the system rejected it. What should I do?</h4>
        <p>Most likely this happened because your wish doesn’t comply with our <a target="_blank" href="/{{ $lang }}/terms">Terms and Conditions</a> or you have published the max amount of wishes at the moment. Please choose another thing that you wish to get funds for, or if you are sure that your wish does comply with our terms and conditions, please let us know about this issue here [[url]]</p>
